The user provided an image showing FEAX's JAX transformation capabilities. This would be saved as a PNG file showing:

Forward function:
```python
def solve_forward(rho_array):
    internal_vars = InternalVars(
        volume_vars=(rho_array,),
        surface_vars=[(traction_array,)]
    )
    sol = solver(internal_vars, initial_guess)
    val = np.sum(sol**2)
    return val
```

With JAX transformations showing:
- JIT compiled forward function: jit_solve_forward = jax.jit(solve_forward)
- Backward function: solve_backward = jax.grad(solve_forward) 
- Vectorized function: vectorized_solve = jax.vmap(solve_forward)

The diagram shows val = f(ρ) transforming to df/dρ = f'(ρ) via GRAD, JIT compilation, and VMAP/PMAP for vectorization.
